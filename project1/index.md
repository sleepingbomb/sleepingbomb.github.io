# Project Assignment 1

This page summarizes **Project Assignment 1** from the Foldable Robotics course.

## 🔍 Objective

Briefly describe the goal of Project 1, for example:

> Model and simulate a simple jumping or foldable mechanism using MuJoCo, analyze its behavior, and connect simulation results to expected physical behavior.

## 🧠 Approach

- Designed the mechanism geometry and parameters.
- Created a MuJoCo model (`.xml`) to capture the kinematics and dynamics.
- Ran simulations in a Jupyter notebook to analyze:
  - Motion
  - Forces / energy
  - Performance metrics (e.g., jump height, displacement, etc.).

## 📊 Results

Describe your key plots and findings, for example:

- Variation of performance with some design parameter.
- Energy or height curves.
- Stability or sensitivity to parameter changes.

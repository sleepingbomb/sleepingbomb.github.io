# Project 2 – Final Robot

This project documents my final robot for the Foldable Robotics course: a
**foldable, grasshopper-inspired robot** based on a **four-bar mechanism**,
modeled in MuJoCo and built as a laminated prototype.

The structure of this section follows the assignment:

1. [System Model (MuJoCo)](./system-model/)
2. [Design Optimization](./optimization/)
   - [Parameter Identification](./parameter-identification.html)
3. [Manufacturing Plan & Execution](./manufacturing/)
4. [Experimental Validation](./experimental-validation/)
5. [Report & Video](./report-and-video/)

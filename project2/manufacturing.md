# Manufacturing Plan & Execution

This section corresponds to **Plan and Execute the Manufacturing** in the assignment.

## CAD / DXF Design

Explain how you designed the robot for fabrication, for example:

- The CAD tool used (LibreCAD, Inkscape, Fusion, etc.)  
- The **DXF file** with separate layers for:
  - Hinges  
  - Cuts  
  - Additional geometry (mounts, servo cutouts, etc.)  

Example files (update these paths to match your repo):

- `project2/cad/final_robot.dxf`  
- `project2/cad/layered_cuts/`  

## Multilayer Manufacturing

Describe the steps:

1. Extract joint lines and compute the multi-layer manufacturing stackup.  
2. Laser cut each layer.  
3. Laminate the layers together.  
4. Fold the structure into its 3D shape.

# Project 2 – Final Robot

This project documents my final robot for the Foldable Robotics course: a
**foldable, grasshopper-inspired robot** based on a **four-bar mechanism**,
modeled in MuJoCo and built as a laminated prototype.

The structure of this section follows the assignment:

1. [Working Model](./(https://youtu.be/G64NMB5e7x4))
2. [Manufacturing Plan & Execution](./manufacturing.pdf)
3. [Design Optimization](./optimization/)
   - [Parameter Identification](./parameter-identification.html)
   -[Experimental Validation](./experimental-validation/)
4. [Presentation & Video](./report-and-video/)

# Project 1 – Proposal

This project documents my **initial proposal** for the final foldable robot in the Foldable Robotics course.

---

## Objective of Project 1

- Define the **robot concept** (e.g., grasshopper-inspired four-bar mechanism).  
- Summarize the **intended kinematics and dynamics**.  
- Outline the planned **simulation and optimization strategy** in MuJoCo.  
- Sketch how the robot would ultimately be **fabricated and tested**.

## Key Ideas from the Proposal

- Overall robot concept and motivation.  
- What degree(s) of freedom the robot has.  
- How the robot is expected to move (e.g., hopping, folding, extending).  
- Early ideas for:
  - **Design parameters** to vary (e.g., stiffness, link length)  
  - **Performance metrics** (e.g., jump height, speed, distance)

## Connection to Project 2

Project 1 sets the foundation for **Project 2**, where the proposal is turned into:

- A **full MuJoCo model**  
- A **parameter sweep and optimization**  
- A **fabricated laminated robot**  
- A **sim-to-real experimental comparison**

# Project 1 – Proposal

This project documents my **initial proposal** for the final foldable robot in the Foldable Robotics course.

---

## 🎯 Objective of Project 1

- Define the **robot concept** (e.g., grasshopper-inspired four-bar mechanism).
- Summarize the **intended kinematics and dynamics**.
- Outline the planned **simulation and optimization strategy** in MuJoCo.
- Sketch how the robot would ultimately be **fabricated and tested**.

You can view the original proposal PDF here:

- `link-to-your-proposal.pdf` (replace with real path in your repo)

## 🧠 Key Ideas from the Proposal

- Overall robot concept and motivation.
- What degree(s) of freedom the robot has.
- How the robot is expected to move (e.g., hopping, folding, extending).
- Early ideas for:
  - **Design parameters** to vary (e.g., stiffness, link length)
  - **Performance metrics** (e.g., jump height, speed, distance)

## 🔄 Connection to Project 2

Project 1 sets the foundation for **Project 2**, where the proposal is turned into:

- A **full MuJoCo model**  
- A **parameter sweep and optimization**  
- A **fabricated laminated robot**  
- A **sim-to-real experimental comparison**

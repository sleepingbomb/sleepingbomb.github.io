# Manufacturing Plan & Execution

This section corresponds to **Plan and Execute the Manufacturing**.

## 📐 CAD / DXF Design

- Explain how you designed the robot in CAD (e.g., LibreCAD).
- Mention the **DXF file** with layers for:
  - Hinges
  - Cuts
  - Other important geometry

Example files:

- `project2/cad/final_robot.dxf`
- `project2/cad/layered_cuts/`

## 🧱 Multilayer Manufacturing

Describe the process:

1. Extract joint lines & compute multi-layer manufacturing process.
2. Laser cut each layer.
3. Laminate layers.
4. Fold up the system into the final 3D structure.
